ðŸ“˜ School Management System API â€“ Description
This project is a School Management System API built to streamline and automate core administrative and academic activities in an educational institution. It is designed to serve as the backend engine for managing the entire lifecycle of students, teachers, academic sessions, courses, results, and financial transactions.

The system supports role-based access for Students, Teachers, and Administrators, enabling them to perform operations relevant to their roles through secure and well-structured API endpoints.

âœ¨ Core Features:
User Authentication & Role Management
Secure signup, login, and role-based permissions (e.g., Admin, Student, Teacher).

Dashboard & Onboarding
Personalized dashboards showing key metrics, announcements, and updates upon login.

Course & Session Management
Allows students to register for courses and academic sessions, while admins manage offerings and enrollment.

Payments & Transactions
Integration with payment gateways to handle tuition fee payments, session registrations, and payment history.

Results Management
Teachers can upload grades, while students can view their performance reports per session/term.

Reporting & Analytics
Administrators can generate academic, financial, and user engagement reports to support decision-making.

Communication & Announcements
Centralized notice system to keep students and staff informed on events, deadlines, and institutional news.

This API is a foundational component for building a full-fledged school portal and can be integrated with a frontend or mobile application to provide a seamless user experience for all stakeholders in an educational institution.
